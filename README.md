- 👋 Hi, I’m Ashley Wambach. 
- 👀 I’m interested in lots of things! Mainly am a gamer girl, love my Nintendo games and love to play them to unwind after a busy day. I also enjoy cooking, baking, and doing diamond paintings :)
- 🌱 I’m currently in the final leg of bootcamp! I've learned Java, MERN (React/Javascript) and Python. I also have learned SQL and MongoDB back-ends. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any entry-level back-end projects!
- 📫 How to reach me - email is best, or you can send me a message on here!
